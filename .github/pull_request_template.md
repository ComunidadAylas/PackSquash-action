<!--

Many thanks for taking the time to improve the project from its source!

This is just a pull request template. It may happen that some of its sections may not be suitable for your pull request. You can tweak, add or remove sections as you deem fit, but please think twice before doing so: this template intends to make it easier to communicate your changes to other people effectively. Omitting necessary, non-obvious information from your PR may render it inappropriate, less effective, and harder to review.

Before submitting your pull request, please make sure that it follows the contributing guidelines at
https://github.com/ComunidadAylas/PackSquash-action/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md.

Also, don't forget to remove this comment and the line break that follows it!

After your pull request is submitted, fellow developers will try to review it and communicate their disposition to merge it as soon as possible.
