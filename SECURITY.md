# üõ°Ô∏è Security Policy

This project shares its security policy with the main PackSquash project. Such
policy is available
[here](https://github.com/ComunidadAylas/PackSquash/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

## Supported Versions

As an exception to the version support policy described in the document linked
above, we will accept security reports for the latest stable v2.x.x version of
the PackSquash GitHub action. Any applicable security patches or critical fixes
will be backported.

The extended support for the older major version is provided with the sole
intention of accomodating use cases that require older PackSquash versions,
which newer action versions do not support yet. This extended support may be
dropped in the future if we deem the older PackSquash versions irrelevant enough
or if support for those PackSquash versions is re-added. **We strongly
discourage using older versions of the action unless really necessary**.
