  path:
    description: 'Relative path from the repository root to the pack directory.'
    required: false
    default: '.'
  system_id:

    description: 'The PackSquash version the action will use. Please note that too old or too new versions may be incompatible or not properly supported by the action.'
    required: false
    default: 'v0.3.1'
  options_file:
    description: 'Use the specified options file instead of generating one with this action. Use this if you already have an options file you want to use with this action, or the options this action offers are not enough for your needs.

    default: '0'
  never_store_squash_times:
    description: 'This parameter controls whether PackSquash will refuse to store the metadata needed to reuse previously generated ZIP files, and likewise not expect such data if the output ZIP file already exists, thus not reusing its contents to speed up the process in any way, no matter what the zip_spec_conformance_level is.'
