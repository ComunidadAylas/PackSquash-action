author: 'sya-ri, Alejandro "AlexTMjugador" González'
inputs:
  # Action options
  path:
    description: 'Relative path from the repository root to the directory of the pack that will be processed by the action.'
    required: false
    default: '.'
  system_id:
    description: 'The system identifier PackSquash will use to generate cryptographic secrets. Unless you know what you are doing, it is recommended to leave this parameter unset, as doing so will let the action generate and use a suitable system identifier automatically.'
    required: false
    default: ''
  packsquash_version:
    description: 'The PackSquash version the action will use. Please note that too old or too new versions may be incompatible or not properly supported by the action.'
    required: false
    default: 'v0.3.1'
  options_file:
    description: 'Use the specified options file instead of generating one with this action. Use this if you already have an options file you want to use with this action, or the options this action offers are not enough for your needs. Please note that the action relies on PackSquash generating an output file at a fixed location, so it will ignore the value of the output_file_path option and it should be removed from the options file.'
    required: false
    default: ''
  token:
    description: 'The GitHub API authentication token that will be used for operations that may require authentication.'
    required: false
    default: ${{ github.token }}
  action_cache_revision:
    description: 'The revision of the cache the action uses internally. You should only need to change this revision if you want the action to not reuse any cached information, like the system identifier, or want to isolate jobs from each other due to undesired interferences between them. This will render any previously generated ZIP file unusable for speed optimizations unless you manage the system identifier yourself.'
    required: false
    default: ''
  artifact_name:
    description: 'The name of the workflow artifact containing the generated ZIP file that the action will upload. Later steps in the workflow will be able to download it by this name. Changing this may be needed in complex workflows, where the action runs several times.'
    required: false
    default: 'Optimized pack'
  show_emoji_in_packsquash_logs:

  percentage_of_zip_structures_tuned_for_obfuscation_discretion:
    description: 'If zip_spec_conformance_level is set to disregard, this parameter sets the approximate probability for each internal generated ZIP file structure to be stored in a way that favors additional discretion of the fact that protection techniques were used, as opposed to a way that favors increased compressibility of the result ZIP file.'
    required: false
    default: '0'
  never_store_squash_times:
    description: 'This parameter controls whether PackSquash will refuse to store the metadata needed to reuse previously generated ZIP files, and likewise not expect such data if the output ZIP file already exists, thus not reusing its contents to speed up the process in any way, no matter what the zip_spec_conformance_level is.'
    required: false
    default: 'false'
  transcode_ogg:
