inputs:
  # Action options
  path:
    description: 'Relative path from the repository root to the pack directory.'
    required: false
    default: '.'
  system_id:
    description: 'The system identifier PackSquash will use to generate cryptographic secrets. Unless you know what are you doing, it is recommended to leave this parameter unset, as doing so will let the action generate and use a suitable system identifier automatically.'
    required: false
    default: ''
  packsquash_version:
    description: 'The PackSquash version the action will use. Please note that too old or too new versions may be incompatible or not properly supported by the action.'
    required: false
    default: 'latest'
  options_file:
    description: 'Use the specified options file instead of generating one with this action. Use this if you already have an options file you want to use with this action, or the options this action offers are not enough for your needs. Please note that the action relies on PackSquash generating an output file at /var/lib/packsquash/pack.zip.'
    required: false
    default: ''
  token:
    description: 'The GitHub API authentication token that will be used for operations that may require authentication.'
    required: false
    default: ${{ github.token }}
  action_cache_revision:
    description: 'The revision of the cache the action uses internally. You should only need to bump this revision if for some reason you want the action to not reuse any cached information, like the system identifier. This will render any previously generated ZIP file unusable for speed optimizations.'
    required: false
    default: ''
  artifact_name:
    description: 'The name of the workflow artifact containing the generated ZIP file that the action will upload. Later steps in the workflow will be able to download it by this name. Changing this may be needed in complex workflows, where several ZIP files are generated.'

  # Inputs that set PackSquash options

    default: 'false'
  zip_compression_iterations:
    description: 'The number of Zopfli compression iterations that PackSquash will do when compressing a file of magnitude 1 MiB just before it is added to the generated ZIP file. This affects files whose contents are not already compressed, or all files if recompress_compressed_files is enabled.'

    default: '20'
  automatic_minecraft_quirks_detection:
    description: 'Sets whether PackSquash will automatically deduce an appropriate set of Minecraft quirks that affect how pack files can be optimized, by looking at the pack files, or not.

    required: false
    default: 'true'
  work_around_grayscale_images_gamma_miscorrection_quirk:
    description: 'This parameter sets whether a quirk with grayscale images will be worked around. You should only change the default value if needed. Please read https://github.com/ComunidadAylas/PackSquash/wiki/Options-files#work_around_minecraft_quirks for more details.'
    required: false
    default: 'false'
  work_around_java8_zip_parsing_quirk:
    description: 'This parameter sets whether a quirk with how older Minecraft versions read ZIP files will be worked around, that may render them unable to read the ZIP files PackSquash generates when `zip_spec_conformance_level` is set to `disregard`. You should only change the default value if needed. Please read https://github.com/ComunidadAylas/PackSquash/wiki/Options-files#work_around_minecraft_quirks for more details.'
    required: false
    default: 'false'

    required: false
    default: 'false'
  skip_pack_icon:
    description: 'If true, the pack.png file that contains the resource pack icon will not be included in the result ZIP file. As of Minecraft 1.16.3, the icon of server resource packs is not displayed, so this optimization does not have any drawbacks in this case.'
    required: false
    default: 'false'
  validate_pack_metadata_file:
    description: 'If true, the pack metadata file, pack.mcmeta, will be parsed and validated for errors. Otherwise, it will not be validated. Validating the pack metadata is usually a good thing, because Minecraft requires it to load a pack.'
    required: false
    default: 'true'
  ignore_system_and_hidden_files:
    description: 'If true, PackSquash will skip and not print progress messages for system (i.e. clearly not for use with Minecraft) and hidden (i.e. whose name starts with a dot) files and folders.'
    required: false
    default: 'true'
  zip_spec_conformance_level:
    description: 'This parameter lets you choose the ZIP specification conformance level that is most suitable to your pack and situation. Please read https://github.com/ComunidadAylas/PackSquash/wiki/Options-files#zip_spec_conformance_level for more information.'
    required: false
    default: 'high'
  size_increasing_zip_obfuscation:
    description: 'If zip_spec_conformance_level is set to disregard, enabling this parameter will add more protections against inspecting, extracting or tampering with the generated ZIP file that will slightly increase its size.'
    required: false
    default: 'false'
  percentage_of_zip_structures_tuned_for_obfuscation_discretion:
    description: 'If zip_spec_conformance_level is set to disregard, this parameter sets the approximate probability for each internal generated ZIP file structure to be stored in a way that favors additional discretion of the fact that protection techniques were used, as opposed to a way that favors increased compressibility of the result ZIP file.'
    required: false
    default: '0'
  never_store_squash_times:
    description: 'This parameter controls whether PackSquash will refuse to store the metadata needed to reuse previously generated ZIP files, and likewise not expect such data if the output ZIP file already exists, thus not reusing its contents to speed up the process in any way, no matter what the zip_spec_conformance_level is.'
